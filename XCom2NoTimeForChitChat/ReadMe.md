# NoTimeForChitChat

Stops Tygan, Shen and Central from relating amusing anecdotes and personal histories.

Also stops terror mission reminders to find civilians; removes alien sighting
voiceovers for the most commonly encountered alien types (low tier ADVENT
troopers, sectoids, and psi-zombies); removes all reminders and musings;
removes reminders to find or allocate engineers and scientists; stops final
mission per turn taunts/nags; and stops Shen and Tygan from saying hello,
potentially interrupting more interesting narratives.
